Created: 11/05/2024

## Introduction
Hello I am Alan Liang.
I have a deep interest into Physics and Astrophysics and with a strong background into Python and Pygame, I have created a planet orbit simulator which takes in real data and uses Newton's law of universal gravitation to simulate the gravity between two celestial bodies.


# Features
* Uses real data.
* Adjustable time scale.
* Shows more info about selected planet

## Limitations
* Not fully optimised, can cause FPS issues
* Sun's radius is not to scale.
* No moons.
